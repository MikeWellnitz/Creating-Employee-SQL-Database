## Project Description

Given six (6) files in CSV format from a fictitious company, I am going to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. For this project, I am going to design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then find information from the data. I will be doing data modeling, data engineering and data analysis.

## Getting Started

All code necessary to create the tables for the CSV is contained in the "employeeSQL.sql" file. Once the tables have been created, you can populate the tables by importing the same-named CSV from the "data" folder. If you would like to view the EDR for this project, it is the PNG file called "QuickDBD-export.png".

## Dataset Overview

The tables and inspiration for this project came from my University of Minnesota Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp, Module 9, March 2023 cohort. 

## Data Analysis

This is the information I retrieved: 
1.  List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
2.  List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
3.  List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
4.  List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5.  List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
6.  List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
7.  List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
8.  List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
